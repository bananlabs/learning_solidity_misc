/* -- A simple contract that replies with 'pong'
   -- when you enter 'ping'. This contract make
   -- use of string manipulation which in solidity
   -- could be costly in terms of gas fee.
   -- Be careful when you use strings manipulation.
   -- This is just an exercise. 
   -- Its a good idea to use Remix IDE 
   -- to run those contracts.
